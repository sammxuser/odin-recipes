        <li>4 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cups dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>3 cups chopped carrots</li>
        <li>3 cups cubed Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh peas</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175
          degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
          Season beef with salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add flour and
          paprika and toss until evenly coated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat oil in an oven-safe Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in
          batches, sear beef cubes, stirring occasionally, until well-browned,
          10 to 11 minutes per batch. Transfer beef to a plate and leave
          drippings in the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add onions to the drippings; season with salt and pepper. Cook and
          stir until they begin to caramelize, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and
          stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in tomato paste and cook until it turns brown and begins to
          caramelize and stick to the bottom of the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour red wine into the pot and bring to a boil while scraping the
          browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
          Cook until wine is almost evaporated, about 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add dried thyme, dried rosemary, herbes de Provence, and bay leaves.
          Stir in 2 cups broth and Worcestershire sauce; bring to a boil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return beef to the pot, then remove from the heat and cover with the
          lid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Braise stew in the preheated oven until beef is almost tender, about 1
          1/2 hours. Remove from the oven.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add carrots, potatoes, and more beef broth if needed. Cover and return
          to the oven to braise until beef and vegetables are tender, about 30
          minutes longer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Discard bay leaves. Stir in peas, fresh rosemary, and fresh thyme.
          Serve hot.
        </li>
